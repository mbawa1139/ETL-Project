# ETL- Project
using using CVS files from https://www.kaggle.com/silicon99/dft-accident-data, 
we plan to combine 3 data sources referring to Car Accidents, 
Car Accident Casualties and Vehicles involved in the Accidents.
After collecting these datapoint and filtering by vehicle type, 
we aim to create a database that can show all accidents that involve motorcycles, 
which can then be sorted further by gender, age and location.
